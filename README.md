My name is Stephanie, and I am learning HTML and CSS! Here is a bit about what I'm doing and some thoughts:
I am on my third month of a certificate program for Front End Web Development, and I must say this stuff is great.
First, there was getting familiar with HTML structure and tags, learning how to utilize the elements, writing down content, formatting with CSS...
Truly, I've learned so much and I see that there will always be more to learn.
I've noticed that there are many ways to create the same page. I feel fortunate to have such experienced professionals teach us web best practices.
Admittedly, I have gotten lost in class a few times, but I've stubbornly tried to figure it out before asking for help. It has been worth it.
The instructors are great, and I've managed to grasp contents fairly quickly thanks to their thorough and focused explanations, as well as guided practices.
Sometimes the code will not display in the way I intend it to, and those ever present scenarios have been good experience.
They've been excellent opportunities for me to practice honing in my energies into finding solutions. Any other type of thinking won't do. It is so rewarding to be able to look at the code, analyze it and check for mistakes, have a good idea of what I'm dealing with, come up with possible fixes, and then test them out until one finally works!
Now, we're moving unto responsive web. The concept are planted in my mind, and there is nothing better than practice.
